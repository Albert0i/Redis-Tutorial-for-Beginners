In the pre-SQL era, database organization and access methods were quite different from what we are familiar with today. Various approaches were used to store and access data, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here is a summary of database organization and access methods from the pre-SQL era:

One prevalent method was the hierarchical model, where data was organized in a tree-like structure. Each record had a parent-child relationship with other records, forming a hierarchy. This approach was widely used in early database management systems like IBM's Information Management System (IMS). However, the hierarchical model had limitations in terms of flexibility and scalability. It was challenging to represent complex relationships between data elements, and any changes to the structure required significant effort.

Another approach was the network model, which extended the hierarchical model by allowing records to have multiple parent-child relationships, forming a more complex network structure. The CODASYL (Conference on Data Systems Languages) network model was popular during this period. It introduced the concept of sets and linked records through pointers. The network model provided more flexibility in representing relationships, but it suffered from complexity and difficulty in managing the network structure.

Flat files were also commonly used for data storage. They were simple text files where data was stored sequentially, with each record occupying a line in the file. Fields were typically delimited by special characters like commas or tabs. Flat files were easy to create and process, but they lacked the ability to enforce data relationships or perform complex queries. Applications had to handle file I/O operations and implement data integrity checks manually.

To improve access speed, the Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) was introduced. ISAM combined indexed files with sequential access. It involved creating an index structure that allowed for efficient retrieval of records based on key values. ISAM improved data access speed compared to purely sequential files. However, it still required manual management of indices and lacked the declarative querying capabilities of SQL.

Indexed files were another approach that added an index structure to flat files, enabling faster access and retrieval of records based on key values. The index contained pointers to the physical locations of the records, facilitating quicker data retrieval. Indexed files improved data access performance, but they still required manual management of indices and lacked the data independence provided by SQL.

Overall, the pre-SQL era database organization and access methods had several limitations. They often lacked data independence, requiring applications to be tightly coupled with the physical storage structure. Data integrity constraints were manually implemented, leading to potential inconsistencies. The query capabilities were limited, making it challenging to express complex relationships and retrieve data efficiently. Scalability and adaptability were also concerns, as these methods struggled to handle changing requirements and large datasets.

The introduction of the relational model and SQL addressed many of these limitations. The relational model provided a logical and flexible way to organize data, allowing for relationships between tables and enforcing data integrity constraints. SQL emerged as a standardized and powerful query language, enabling declarative and expressive queries without needing to specify access paths and algorithms. These advancements revolutionized database management and laid the foundation for modern database systems.

In summary, the pre-SQL era witnessed various database organization and access methods such as the hierarchical model, network model, flat files, ISAM, and indexed files. Despite their contributions, these methods had limitations in data independence, data integrity enforcement, query capabilities, and scalability. The introduction of the relational model and SQL brought significant advancements, providing data independence, declarative querying, and improved scalability, setting the stage for the modern database management systems we use today.
